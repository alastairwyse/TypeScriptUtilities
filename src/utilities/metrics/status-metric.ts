/**
 * @name StatusMetric
 * @desc Base class for metrics representing an event which has a value associated with it, and where the value represents a point in time status which may fluctuate over time but does not accumulate.
 * @example Examples of derived classes could be metrics representing the amount of free memory in the system, or the number of active worker threads in a multi-threaded application at a given time.  The distinction between metrics represented by this class and those represented by the AmountMetric class, is that the accumulated value of amount metrics over a time period has meaning (e.g. to find the average amount over a series of instances of the metric, or over a time period).  The summing of instances of status metrics over time however, has little meaning.
